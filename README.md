# webClass
my django code for my web class, which does not include the master files for security reasons

note: the api calls require access to csrf tokens, so lmk if you want access

# teachers:
HTML:<br>
webClass/templates/webClass/project-x<br>
CSS:<br>
webClass/static/webClass/project-x/css<br>
JS:<br>
webClass/static/webClass/project-x/js<br>

note: project-0 files are base files/templates so that the api can quickly generate new projects
